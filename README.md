# dotfiles

contains config files as well as some files that I would want on every new system (i.e my selectively curated wallpaper options)

need to make script to install packages i would want on all systems (i.e synth-shell discord firefox git) 

should make possibly seprate repo or scripts for different setups in future (i.e script to replicate i3 + arch env) 

should run PlugInstall in vim for plugins to take effect... i think... this is untested for now (probably long time) but should most likely work
